<p> Released in 2016 </p>
<p>Youngblood starts with its title track; the simple strums and honest vocals of frontman Luke Hemmings. Its interest slowly creeps with light layers of percussion and synth. However, it’s once the hard-hitting bass in its chorus roars that you can fully fathom the direction of this album.
The punk sensibilities of 5 Seconds Of Summer have been hung and left to dry on this record. In 5 Seconds Of Summer’s retrospect, change has been a good thing. They’ve reached their second Australian #1 with this title track alone and taken over radio airwaves around the world and all in all, Youngblood is already promising. </p>

<p> Released in 2018 </p>
<p>The Album of Sounds Good Feels Good came out in 2016. Teenagers swooned, tours sold out and millions of records were shifted. Their effervescent, ultra-melodic blueprint is refined here, with tracks like "Jet Black Heart," "Broken Home," and “Airplanes" showcasing a maturing subtlety. But no one unleashes boisterous anthems better. The opening salvo in particular–“Money," "She’s Kinda Hot," and "Hey Everybody!"–is the very appealing sound of a band having the time of their lives.</p>
<ul>

        <li>Lie to Me</li>
        <li>Stay</li>
        <li>Moving Along</li>
    </ul>
